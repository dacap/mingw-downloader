MinGW Downloader - Copyright (C) 2010 by David Capello

==============
 INSTRUCTIONS
==============

1. Uncompress MinGW-Downloader.zip in C:\Compilers (or any
   other folder without spaces)
2. Execute C:\Compilers\MinGW-Downloader\MinGW-4.5-Downloader.bat
3. Wait until it finishes.
4. Done, you get "MinGW-4.5" folder with gcc 4.5 and batch file
   named "Run-cmd-with-MinGW-4.5.bat" which setups the PATH directory
   to use gcc and g++ from the command line.

Finally the "MinGW-4.5" folder and "Run-cmd-with-MinGW-4.5.bat" file
are portable, which means that you can copy both in a pen drive and
use them anywhere.
